## What is Linear Regression ?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ee62362bc8"
```

`@part1`
A method to predict numerical variables from the set of other variables.

Also called Supervised Learning.
- Values to be predicted are called target, denoted by `(y1, y2, y3.. yn)`

- Variables used for prediction are called predictors, denoted by `(x1, x2.. xn)` 

Multiple Linear Regression is denoted by below equation

          Y = B0 + B1 X1+ B2 X2+ B3 X3+....+Bn Xn
