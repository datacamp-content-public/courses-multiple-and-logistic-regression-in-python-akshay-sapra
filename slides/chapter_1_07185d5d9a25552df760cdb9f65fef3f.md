## What is Linear Regression ?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ee62362bc8"
```

`@part1`
A method to predict numerical variables from the set of other variables.

Also called Supervised Learning.
- Values to be predicted are called target, denoted by `(y1, y2, y3.. yn)`

- Variables used for prediction are called predictors, denoted by `(x1, x2.. xn)` 

Multiple Linear Regression is denoted by below equation

## Before we Start,

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7f9f7d9dee"
```

`@part1`
Concept of distribution of Population and their parameters.
For Example,
- If the population is normally distributed, it's parameters are it's mean and standard deviation.
- If the population is Bernoulli distribution then it's parameter will be Probability of Success (P).


`@script`
I am hoping in previous lessons you went through the concept of distribution of population and their parameters.

## What is this Estimate ?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b102e0e3a8"
```

`@part1`
Any Statistic used to estimate the value of an unknown parameter is called **estimator** and the observed value of the estimator is called **estimate**.

 **Example:**   Obtain MLE for the *mean* number of random spikes or noise collected in the space program.

`We take only 10 samples, where Number of Random Spikes in each sample:  5, 6, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8, 7, 10, 11`
     
    data <- c(5, 6, 10, 9, 8, 7, 8, 7, 10, 11)

    #computational function 
    fn <- function(lambda) { 
       val <- 0 
       for (i in 1:10) { 
           # OK for skipping factorial(data[i])
           val <- val + data[i]*log(lambda) - lambda
       } return(val) 
    } optimize(fn, c(2,15), maximum = TRUE, tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25)

## Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "50c9ffcefb"
```

`@part1`
It is a method of estimating the parameters of a population by **maximising** the **likelihood function**.
